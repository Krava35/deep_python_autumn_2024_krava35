Traffic dies while we are racing home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it cause I have been chasing
Another odyssey oh
I can not wait to see your face
Crash when we are switching lanes
My love is beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We are dancing in the flames
It is indescribable
Ooh yeah
The world can not heal they say on the radio Oh no
So grab the wheel want you to be in control
We are dodging headlights and you say Hold tight
Another odyssey oh hey
I can not wait to see your face
Crash when we are switching lanes
My love is beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We are dancing in the flames
It is indescribable
Ooh Indescribable oh
Ooh
Everything is faded we barely made it
The fire is raging but you are still beautiful
And it is amazing cause I can taste it
Our final odyssey oh
I can not wait to see your face Can not wait to see ha
Crash when we are switching lanes
My love is beyond the pain Hey
But if I miss the brake
We are dancing in the flames Dancing in the flames
So just have faith Just have faith in me
We will never be the same We will never be never be
It is indescribable
Ooh Indescribable oh hey
Ooh Indescribable
